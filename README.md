# Banana 0.9: An Open-Source, Reproducible Medical Imaging System for Low-Resource Gastric Cancer Screening

[![License: CC BY-NC 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC_BY--NC_4.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)

## Overview
**Banana 0.9** is a fully open-source, reproducible medical imaging system designed for gastric cancer CT screening in low-resource settings.  
It is a lightweight, CPU-friendly implementation that provides the core functionality described in the author’s earlier research, optimized for reproducibility and easy deployment.

⚠ **Disclaimer**: This tool is a research prototype and **not** intended for clinical diagnosis.

Key features:
- **GPU-Free**: Runs on standard CPU hardware, no high-end GPU required.
- **Multi-format input**: Supports DICOM, NIfTI, and ZIP files.
- **Automatic dual-report generation**:
  - Professional report (`_report_pro.txt`)
  - Patient-friendly summary (`_report_easy.txt`)
- **Lightweight & reproducible**: Includes a minimal sample dataset for one-click execution.

## Installation
Python 3.13 on Windows is recommended. Other versions may require dependency adjustments.

### 1. Install dependencies
The `.bat` script will automatically create a virtual environment and install dependencies.  
To install manually:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-py313.txt
````

Main dependencies:

* numpy
* pydicom
* nibabel
* matplotlib
* tqdm
* fpdf2
* Pillow
* SimpleITK

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ohahouhui/Banana-0.9
cd Banana0.9
```

2. **Run the one-click script**

```bash
Double-click run_py313.bat
```

3. **Check the output**

* Output directory: `outputs/`
* Professional report: `*_report_pro.txt`
* Patient-friendly summary: `*_report_easy.txt`
* Overlay image: `*_overlay_z50.png`
